JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a light-weight, text-based data format designed for data interchange. It is the dominant format used when data is sent from a server to a web page (and vice-versa). Although JSON originates from JavaScript, it is language-independent, meaning nearly all modern programming languages (like Python, Java, and C#) can easily generate and parse JSON data. Its simple structure—consisting primarily of attribute-value pairs (like a dictionary or map)—makes it easily readable by both humans and machines.
